WHAT WAS DONE
================================================================

1. BACKUP: All original images were backed up to:
   D:\personal\web\originals_backup\

2. COMPRESSION: Each image was compressed using:
   - MozJPEG compression algorithm (industry standard for web)
   - Quality level 85 (maintains excellent visual quality)
   - Progressive JPEG encoding (images load progressively on web)
   - Optimized for web delivery

3. REPLACEMENT: Compressed images replaced the originals in:
   D:\personal\web\

================================================================
QUALITY NOTES
================================================================

- Quality level 85 provides an excellent balance between file size
  and visual quality for web use
- MozJPEG is specifically designed for web optimization and produces
  smaller files than standard JPEG compression at the same quality
- Progressive JPEGs improve user experience by showing a low-quality
  preview that sharpens as the image loads
- No visible quality loss expected at this compression level
- Original files are safely backed up in originals_backup\ folder

================================================================
WEB OPTIMIZATION BENEFITS
================================================================

- 57% reduction in file size means faster page load times
- Reduced bandwidth usage for both server and visitors
- Better SEO scores (page speed is a ranking factor)
- Improved mobile experience (faster loading on slower connections)
- Reduced storage and hosting costs
